### Controllers

The **controllers** folder holds the files that are responsible for responding to user inputs, and accessing models/calling views appropriately.

 * `list_controller.rb`: Accesses the Schedule model to retrieve pending appointments and then passing those to the view
 * `menu_controller.rb`: Master controller which handles main menu activities and prompts the list and schedule controllers when given appropriate user input
 * `schedule_controller.rb`: Accesses Schedule, Appointment models, interacts with the view to get incremental information and create an appointment

### Helpers

The **helpers** folder holds the files that are responsible for formatting certain things for the view, and also validations for model instance creation.

  * `list_helper.rb`: Helps format attributes of Appointment model instances when a user wants to list all appointments
  * `schedule_helper.rb`: Helps format attributes of Appointment model for views, validates format and timing for Appointment creation

### Models

The **models** folder holds the files that are responsible for storage of primary, pertinent data to the program, such as appointments.

  * `appointment.rb`: Maintains data for general appointments, such as client name, start/end times, etc.
  * `haircut.rb`: Inherits from appointment, specifies duration of appointment
  * `schedule.rb`: Maintains data for schedule, holds all created appointments and a time table to tell which time slots are booked
  * `shampoohaircut.rb`: Inherits from appointment, specifies duration of appointment

### Views

The **views** folder holds files responsible for displaying all or a portion of the data to the user. They are primarily called by the controller upon appropriate user input.

  * `list_viewer.rb`: Displays list of all appointments
  * `menu_viewer.rb`: Displays welcome message and main menu options
  * `schedule_viewer.rb`: Displays prompts for appointment creation
